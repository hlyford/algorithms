// I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single " riffle â†´ ."

// To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffled_deck is a single
// riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.

// We'll represent a stack of cards as a list of integers in the range
// 1..52 (since there are 52 distinct cards in a deck).

// Why do I care? A single riffle is not a completely random shuffle. If I'm right,
// I can make more informed bets and get rich and finally prove to my ex that I am
// not a "loser with an unhealthy cake obsession" (even though it's too late now because she
// let me go and she's never getting me back).

for (var i = 0; i < 53; i++) {
